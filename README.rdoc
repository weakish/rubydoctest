= Ruby DocTest

Official repository:
	* http://github.com/tablatom/rubydoctest

Wiki documentation:
	* http://github.com/tablatom/rubydoctest/wikis

== Description:

Ruby version of Python's doctest tool, but a bit different. Ruby DocTest
allows you to:

	1. Write tests in irb format and keep them as comments next to your Ruby code.
	2. Write markdown documents with irb format tests embedded in them.

== Synopsis:

rubydoctest comes as an executable that takes a list of files:

  rubydoctest lib/*.rb
	rubydoctest simple.doctest

== Examples:

Here is how you might use RubyDocTest within a ruby source file (say called five.rb):

	# doctest: Add 5 and 5 to get 10
	# >> five_and_five
	# => 10
	def five_and_five
	  5 + 5
	end

Here is an example doctest file (say called simple.doctest):

	# Simple test of RubyDocTest

	This is an example test

		>> 1 + 2
		=> 3

	And here's a test that will fail

		>> 1 + 2
		=> 4

See the doc directory of this project for more .doctest examples and documentation.
