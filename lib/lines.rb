module RubyDocTest
  # === Description
  # Keeps track of which lines within a document belong to a group.  Line groups are
  # determined by their indentation level, as in the Python programming language.
  #
  # === Example
  #  This line and the next one
  #    are part of the same group
  #
  #  But this line is separate from
  #  this line.
  #
  # === Note
  # This class also considers one '#' character (comment) as an indentation character,
  # i.e. similar to how whitespace is treated.

    # >> l = RubyDocTest::Lines.new(["line 1"])
